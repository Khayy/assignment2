<p>Nigerian-Asian Trade Conglomerate is a privately owned, independent, oil trading and investment company registered in the Republic of Marshall Islands. NATC was established by a team of Nigerian and Asian oil and gas professionals with many years of experience in the Crude oil and commodities trading industry. We facilitate and provide assistance, by using our experience and networks to develop a dynamic trading business and to enter into related contracts within the public and private sectors of West Africa specifically to buy / sell crude oil and refined petroleum products. Our vision is to develop a company with a dynamic structure more capable of adjusting to rapidly changing markets, and with a personal focus on client requirements. NATC sources crude oil and refined petroleum products such as aviation jet fuel, Gas-Oil, LPG and LNG from private companies, production companies, oil majors and national governments. We work with small to large-scale producers that seek marketing expertise to help distribute their products globally. In the petroleum products market, we use our global presence, market knowledge and logistics capabilities to balance supply and demand, optimize supply chains and service our customers around the world. We assist refineries; majors and national oil companies get the best feedstock in the world at modest discounts.</p>
